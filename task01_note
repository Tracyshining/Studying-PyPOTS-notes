Task 01 studying note.
I became aware of time-series prediction while conducting research on microgrid scheduling. Initially, I only heard about the LSTM model.
During the learning process of task1, I learned that time-series data can be classified into multiple types based on their characteristics, including univariate and multivariate, as well as equally-spaced and unequally-spaced.
The research I'm doing is relatively simple, focusing on univariate and equally-spaced time-series data.
This classification method is highly beneficial as it enables us to quickly identify the characteristics of the data when dealing with specific problems and select appropriate analysis methods accordingly. 
Time-series data analysis can encompass a variety of tasks, such as prediction, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, generation, and imputation.

Secondly, I got to know about PyPOTS, an open-source toolbox specifically designed for handling Partially Observed Time Series (POTS).
It is dedicated to processing time-series data with missing values. 
PyPOTS offers a variety of imputation algorithms that can effectively recover missing data, thereby enhancing the accuracy of subsequent analysis.
In addition, PyPOTS not only supports missing value imputation but also covers core tasks such as prediction, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.

我因为研究微电网调度而了解到时序预测，一开始只是听说了lstm模型.
在task1学习中，我了解到时间序列数据可以根据其特征分为多种类型，包括单变量和多变量、等间隔和非等间隔，我做的研究比较简单，是单变量等间隔的。
这种分类方式有助于在处理具体问题时，快速定位数据特点，选择合适的分析方法。它可以分析涵盖多种任务，如预测、分类、聚类、异常检测、生成和插补等。
其次是了解了 PyPOTS，其是一个专为处理部分观测时间序列（POTS）而设计的开源工具箱，专注于处理带有缺失值的时间序列数据。
它提供了多种填补算法，能够有效恢复缺失数据，从而提高后续分析的准确性。此外，PyPOTS不仅支持缺失值填补，还涵盖了预测、分类、聚类和异常检测等核心任务。
